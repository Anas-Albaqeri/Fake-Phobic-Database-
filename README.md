The "Database Project- Phase 1" is an extensive and meticulously planned undertaking aimed at designing and implementing a relational database system for "Fake-Phobic News," a fictional newspaper company. The project begins with an introduction that underscores the ongoing relevance and evolution of newspapers in the digital era, highlighting the company's commitment to delivering credible news through both traditional and online mediums. This commitment is underpinned by a focus on diversity, inclusivity, and expansive reach, ensuring that the newspaper caters to a global audience with varied interests and preferences. Central to the project is the use of draw.io, a versatile tool chosen for its collaborative features and ease of use, which facilitated the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This diagram serves as the foundation for the database, visually representing the complex interrelations among various entities like employees, publications, articles, users, clients, and more.

## Entity Sepcifications 
The database's structure is carefully delineated through detailed descriptions of each entity and their attributes, showcasing the comprehensive nature of the system. For instance, publications are identified by ISSN and encompass elements like headlines, publication dates, and types (either printed or online). Articles form a critical part of the publications, with each piece having a unique ID and attributes such as title, body, and author. The system also integrates an online news portal, enhancing accessibility and user engagement through a subscription-based model. A significant portion of the project is dedicated to explaining the relationships between these entities, such as the 'Contains' relationship between publications and articles, and the 'Displays' relationship indicating how publications feature advertisements.

## Mapping 
The technical aspect of the project involves the meticulous process of mapping the ER model to a relational database schema, a critical step in translating the conceptual design into a functional database. This process includes mapping strong and weak entity types and handling various relationship types, such as binary and n-ary relationships, ensuring the database's integrity and efficiency. The SQL section of the project demonstrates the practical application of the design, detailing the creation of tables, defining relationships, and setting constraints. This is followed by data insertion examples, which not only populate the database but also serve as a testament to its robustness and scalability.

## Advanced Queries
One of the project's highlights is the series of SQL queries executed to address specific, realistic scenarios. These queries range from managing supply shortages to optimizing advertisement placements, showcasing the database's utility in practical, real-world applications. The project also emphasizes the importance of normalization, ensuring that each table adheres to the highest standards of data integrity and efficiency. The document concludes with a reflection on the learning outcomes, underscoring the project's success in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. It signifies a comprehensive approach to database design and management, balancing technical prowess with an understanding of the dynamic needs of a modern newspaper company.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project covers the whole process of creating and mainting a database. It covers all the sequential processes from the design of the ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram, implementation of mapping algorithms, creation and population of database tables, execution of queries, and the normalization process. Moreover, the project highlights the educational value gained, and how it helped transforming classroom knowledge to practical scenarios.
